-  Hi, I’m @SanSai01.
-  I'm in love with the elder scrolls series.
-  I’m currently learning a code.
-  I am interested in software and I'm trying to make mods few game(It's not hard to know which games they are).
-  I mostly improve myself with C++/C#(They're both almost the same anyway)language.
- That it ;)
